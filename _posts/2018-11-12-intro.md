I've been trying to help people with programming questions on
[reddit](https://old.reddit.com) and [stack
overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for a while now, and keep seeing
people make the same mistakes, most of which can be boiled down to *I
didn't read the documentation*. I'm going to try to chronicle some of
thse mistakes here, in a FAQ of sorts.

Also any other random notes or thoughts about things I'm interested in
that relate to programming.
